## Agile Methodology

The *Agile methodology* is a way to manage a project by breaking it up into several phases. In fact I made this web app by using the the agile methodology, In the first phase I researched about the technologies which can be used to make a communication app, in the next phase phase I did the app design and in the third phase I completed the mandatory feature. this let to the pre final phase in which I implemented new features and a surprise feature, and in the final phase I did the proper documentation.
